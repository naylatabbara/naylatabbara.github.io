## HI! I’M NAYLA

Communication Designer and Architect.

I’m a 27 year old Lebanese, born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, where I grew up enjoying the country’s rich culture; the different neighborhoods engaged my love for architecture and design.

Recently, my interest shifted to branding, storytelling, graphic and communication design, so I chose to move to Milan to pursue a master’s degree in this field. I’m interested in digital illustration, animations, UX/UI and I know basic coding.

I speak, write and read Arabic, French and English, and I’m currently learning Italian.

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, baking, watching movies (mainly romantic, action and Marvel), going to the gym, and travelling, getting to meet people from different backgrounds and learning about their culture.
